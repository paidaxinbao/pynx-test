PyNX is open-source software. Please read the LICENSE file for more information.

Note that CPU computing uses the sse_mathfun.header, which is distributed
under the zlib license. See http://gruntthepeon.free.fr/ssemath/

The open-source software included in this package can be used for:
 (i) the computing of X-ray scattering using graphical processing units (documentation on http://pynx.sf.net)
 (ii) X-ray wavefield propagation (examples available at the end of wavefield.py)
 (iii) simulation and analysis of experiments using the ‘ptychography’ technique.
       Examples are available in the pynx/Examples directory.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Please note that one company (Phase Focus, UK) has deposited patents which claim covering
parts of the ptychography technique.
We advise you to consult with your legal department if you are unsure about whether
the use of this library for ptychography analysis would require a license for this patent
use, notably for commercial applications.
